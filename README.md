Why do some people experience extraordinary spiritual events while others do not? In four studies, we investigated two factors that might facilitate the anomalous, often sensory events that people attribute to gods, spirits, or supernatural forces: cultural models that represent the mind as “porous,” permeable to the world (_porosity_; see Taylor, 2007) and a person’s tendency to become “absorbed” in experiences (_absorption_; see Tellegen & Atkinson, 1974).

This repo includes analyses of the quantitative data from these four studies, which took place in five international field sites as part of the [Mind and Spirit Project](https://themindandspiritproject.stanford.edu/#Home).

## Study 1

In [Study 1](https://github.com/kgweisman/sense_spirit/tree/master/study1), adults with strong religious commitments and faith practices were interviewed in depth about their spiritual experiences and their understanding of the mind by experienced ethnographers. These interviews yielded one measure of porosity (“Porosity Vignettes”, `pv_score`), one measure of absorption (the Absorption scale, `abs_score`), and one measure of spiritual experience (“Spiritual Events” scale, `spev_score`).

## Study 2

In [Study 2](https://github.com/kgweisman/sense_spirit/tree/master/study2), adults from the general population, as well as a smaller sample of charismatic evangelical Christians, were interviewed briefly about their spiritual experiences and their understanding of the mind. These interviews yielded one measure of porosity (“Porosity Scale”, `por_score`) and one measure of spiritual experience (“Spiritual Events” scale; `spev_score`).

## Study 3

In [Study 3](https://github.com/kgweisman/sense_spirit/tree/master/study3), college undergraduates completed a survey consisting of one measure of absorption (the Absorption scale, `abs_score`) and two measures of spiritual experience (a “Spiritual Events” inventory based on Studies 1 and 2, `spev_score`; and a modified version of the Daily Spiritual Experiences scale [Underwood & Teresi, 2002], `dse_score`).

## Study 4

In [Study 4](https://github.com/kgweisman/sense_spirit/tree/master/study4), college undergraduates completed a survey consisting of nine measures, including two indices of porosity (`pv_score`, `por_score`), the Absorption scale (`abs_score`), two indices of spiritual experience (`spev_score`, `dse_score`), two indices of more secular extraordinary experience (the Hallucinations scale [Morrison et al., 2000]: `hall_score`, and the Paranormal scale [Thalbourne & Delin, 1993]: `para_scale`), and two control measures (the Need for Cognition scale [Cacioppo & Petty, 1982]: `cog_score`, and the Sense of Control, "Mastery" subscale [Lachman & Weaver, 1998]: `ctl_score`). Our analysis of Study 4 closely followed our preregistration of this study (link: https://osf.io/kmtc4).
