In Study 1, adults with strong religious commitments and faith practices were interviewed in depth about their spiritual experiences and their understanding of the mind by experienced ethnographers.

In Study 2, adults from the general population, as well as a smaller sample of charismatic evangelical Christians, were interviewed briefly about their spiritual experiences and their understanding of the mind. 

In Study 3, college undergraduates completed a survey consisting of one measure of absorption (the Absorption scale, `abs_score`) and two measures of spiritual experience (a “Spiritual Events” inventory based on Studies 1 and 2; and a modified version of the Daily Spiritual Experiences scale [Underwood & Teresi, 2002]).

In Study 4, college undergraduates completed a survey consisting of nine measures, including two indices of spiritual experience (Spiritual Events, based on Studies 1-3; and the Daily Spiritual Experiences scale [Underwood & Teresi, 2002]).
